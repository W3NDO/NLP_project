So a general git workflow follows the following steps if you're working in a team.

(I am assuming you are in the folder where you will store the local version of the repo)
The first thing you will do is clone the repository. This creates a copy of the repo on your machine. 
    if you're working via the terminal, cd into the folder then enter this command:

     >> git clone https://github.com/W3NDO/NLP_project.git

    It will create a folder "NLP_project".

The next thing you want to do is create a new branch. 
A branch allows you to make changes without any major effects to the master/main branch.
To create a new branch, in the terminal, type 
    
    >> git checkout -b <branch_name> //this creates a new branch and switches you into that branch

    You can also create a new branch with

    >> git branch <branch_name> //but this still keeps you on the master branch. 
    // to change to a different branch you type
    >> git checkout <branch_name>

Once you have a new branch, you can and enter any text you want.
try making a file called "test.txt"

Once you have finished with your changes, you need to add all the changes to your git. 
This is done with the following command

    >> git add . //this adds all the files

    // You can also add specific files with 
    >> git add <filename>

After adding files, you want to commit the changes. This ensures you don't lose the changes.
It also allows you to rollback changes. You commit with the following command

    >> git commit -m "Commit message explaining changes"
    // the flag -m is for message and it allows you to add a commit message. 
    // Commit messages are important to allow your collaborators to understand what you did.

Now that you are done with your commits, you want to change branch to master. 
Again this is done by:
    
    >> git checkout master
    // You can check what branch you're on with the command
    >> git branch
    // the branch you're working on will have an asterisk to the left of it.

After you have switched back to master, you want to push the changes to the repo on github.
This is kinda trick, but basically:
    >> git push --set-upstream <branchmane> origin master
